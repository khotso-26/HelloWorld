# Hello, World
The "Hello, World" project is a basic Java application that prints the infamous string "Hello, World" by default. However, if the user provides input, it replaces the string "World" in "Hello, World" with the given input string.

## Usage
To use the "Hello, World" application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the project in a Java IDE or editor.
3. Locate the HelloWorld.java file.
4. Build and run the project.
5. Running the Application

To run the application, navigate to the project directory and execute the following command:

```java HelloWorld```

Input and Output
If no input is provided, the application will print the default "Hello, World" message:
`Hello, World`
If the user provides input, the application will replace "World" with the given input string. For example, if the user enters "John" as input, the output will be:
`Hello, John`

## Testing
The project includes a set of tests to ensure the correct functionality of the application. The tests are located in the HelloWorldTest.java file.
